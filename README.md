# Better Democracy Movement

The following repository is a collection of designed democratic systems of governance.  

## The Plan: a system engineering mindset

## Applying political/social blocks

### Local systems

### global systems

systems have a parameter to optimize

## Who are we

## how to use


## contribute

We use a systems engineering mindset to solve political issues. 



The ideas are grouped into 3 categories:

* Principles: Philosophic axioms and claims that form the foundation of political systems. 

* Strategies: Means to carry out principles.

* Systems: Final outcomes and optimized strategies. 

Our systems, Strategies, and Principles are Modular. Meaning each element can be swapped whenever need be and the system will continue functioning. In fact, its essential to design systems that can withstand the test of time by continous change rather than becoming dated and risking system stability. 

## What Are Our Aims

We aim to propose new political systems to represent the progress of thought as well as the advancement of technology.

We suggest ideas and plans to expand our understanding of democracy. To innovate in the most important field that decides the fate of individuals and nations.

We use new technologies, computer science principles, and academic research.

## Our Focus: Iranâ€™s Ongoing Revolution

Most political systems are born whenever there is a revolution or a coup. 

Since most of our original team members are Iranian, we want the latest advances in the field of political sciences to be reflected in the design of the next political system. Iran would be the focus of our team to implement and fight for our ideas. 

Despite this, most of the ideas will be applicable to all humans worldwide. The goals or implementations will be different but the overall design principles would be the same. So the ideas discussed here will function such as examples in a textbook you might read and apply the principles to reach answers for your own regional problems.
